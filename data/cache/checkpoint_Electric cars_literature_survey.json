While reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promising results in simulated environments, discrepancies between simulations and real-world conditions have limited its practical deployment. This study introduces an innovative control framework that integrates trajectory optimization with drift maneuvers, aiming to improve the algorithm's adaptability for real-vehicle implementation. We leveraged Bezier-based pre-trajectory optimization to enhance rewards and optimize the controller through Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) in a simulated environment. For real-world deployment, we implement a hybrid RL-MPC fusion mechanism, , where TD3-derived maneuvers serve as primary inputs for a Model Predictive Controller (MPC). This integration enables precise real-time tracking of the optimal trajectory, with MPC providing corrective inputs to bridge the gap between simulation and reality. The efficacy of this method is validated through real-vehicle tests on consumer-grade electric vehicles, focusing on drift U-turns and drift right-angle turns. The control outcomes of these real-vehicle tests are thoroughly documented in the paper, supported by supplementary video evidence (https://youtu.be/5wp67FcpfL8).

Advani', 'Ajay K. Prasad'], abstract=\"Eco-driving has been shown to reduce energy consumption for electric vehicles (EVs). Such strategies can also be implemented to both reduce energy consumption and improve battery lifetime. This study considers the eco-driving of a connected electric vehicle equipped with vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication passing through two signalized intersections. Dynamic programming is employed to construct an eco-driving algorithm that incorporates a battery degradation model in addition to minimizing energy consumption to optimize the vehicle's speed trajectory while transiting the control zone. A parametric study is conducted for various signal timings and distances between the two intersections. It is found that eco-driving can provide up to 49\\\\% in cost benefits over regular driving due to energy savings and improved battery life which could boost consumers' interests on EVs. This study also considered different battery capacity decay rates based on battery chemistry. Although a higher decay rate affects the optimal speed trajectories only slightly, it amplifies the benefits of eco-driving on battery life. Two battery sizes were also studied to show that the larger battery is associated with a drastically increased lifetime, thus creating opportunities for electric vehicles in other applications such as vehicle-to-grid (V2G) integration. Field tests were also conducted using a simplified rule-based version of the eco-driving algorithm implemented as a phone app which issues audio speed recommendations to the driver. The field test results were promising and validated the results from simulations. The phone app implementation is convenient and could facilitate broader adoption and widespread use of eco-driving which helps to improve transportation efficiency and protect the environment.\", url='http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01685v1', published_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 10, 2, 15, 54, 41, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc), venue='arXiv:eess.SY (Systems and Control)', citations=0, pdf_path=None, full_text=None, keywords=[], doi=None, arxiv_id='2410.01685v1', created_at=datetime.datetime(2025, 8, 13, 9, 45, 1, 887643))",

This combination is particularly advantageous for time-constrained delivery routing in dense urban areas, where battery recharging along routes can be too time-consuming to economically justify the use of all-electric vehicles. However, switching from electric to conventional fossil fuel modes also results in higher costs and emissions and lower efficiency. This paper analyzes this heterogeneous vehicle routing problem and describes two solution methods: an exact branch-price-and-cut algorithm and an iterated tabu search metaheuristic. From a methodological perspective, we find that the exact algorithm consistently obtains tight lower bounds that also serve to certify the metaheuristic solutions as near-optimal. From a policy standpoint, we examine a large-scale real-world case study concerning parcel deliveries in the Chicago metropolitan area and quantify various operational metrics including energy costs and vehicle miles traveled. We find that by deploying roughly 20% of range-extended vehicles with a modest all-electric range of 33 miles, parcel distributors can save energy costs by up to 17% while incurring less than 0.5% increase in vehicle miles traveled. Increasing the range to 60 miles further reduces costs by only 4%, which can alternatively be achieved by decreasing the average service time by 1 minute or increasing driver working time by 1 hour.

Among many others, battery electric vehicles (BEVs) exclusively use chemical energy stored in their battery packs for propulsion. Hence, it becomes important to understand how much energy can be consumed by such vehicles in various traffic scenarios towards effective energy management. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework in this paper by leveraging the federated learning approaches for modelling energy consumption for BEVs (Fed-BEV).

    "Paper(id='arxiv_1112.0697v1', title='A Dynamic Algorithm for Facilitated Charging of Plug-In Electric Vehicles', authors=['Nicole Taheri', 'Robert Entriken', 'Yinyu Ye'], abstract='Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEVs) are a rapidly developing technology that can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and change the way vehicles obtain power. PEV charging stations will most likely be available at home and at work, and occasionally be publicly available, offering flexible charging options. Ideally, each vehicle will charge during periods when electricity prices are relatively low, to minimize the cost to the consumer and maximize societal benefits. A Demand Response (DR) service for a fleet of PEVs could yield such charging schedules by regulating consumer electricity use during certain time periods, in order to meet an obligation to the market. We construct an automated DR mechanism for a fleet of PEVs that facilitates vehicle charging to ensure the demands of the vehicles and the market are met. Our dynamic algorithm depends only on the knowledge of a few hundred driving behaviors from a previous similar day, and uses a simple adjusted pricing scheme to instantly assign feasible and satisfactory charging schedules to thousands of vehicles in a fleet as they plug-in. The charging schedules generated using our adjusted pricing scheme can ensure that a new demand peak is not created and can reduce the consumer cost by over 30% when compared to standard charging, which may also increase peak demand by 3.5%.

Findings \u2013 The authors introduce the concept of sustainability \u2013 the integration of environmental, social, and economic criteria that allow an organization to achieve long\u2010term economic viability \u2013 to the logistics literature, and position sustainability within the broader rubric of SSCM.

Results from animal models, human clinical observations, and epidemiological studies converge to implicate EDCs as a significant concern to public health. The mechanisms of EDCs involve divergent pathways including (but not limited to) estrogenic, antiandrogenic, thyroid, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3, retinoid, and actions through other nuclear receptors; steroidogenic enzymes; neurotransmitter receptors and systems; and many other pathways that are highly conserved in wildlife and humans, and which can be modeled in laboratory in vitro and in vivo models. Furthermore, EDCs represent a broad class of molecules such as organochlorinated pesticides and industrial chemicals, plastics and plasticizers, fuels, and many other chemicals that are present in the environment or are in widespread use.
