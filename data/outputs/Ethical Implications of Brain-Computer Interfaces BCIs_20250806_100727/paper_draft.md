Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper by summarizing the key findings, reiterating the critical importance of proactive ethical engagement, and proposing avenues for future research and policy development in this rapidly evolving domain.

## 2. BCI Integration in the Metaverse: A Comprehensive Review

The burgeoning field of Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) integration within the metaverse represents a critical frontier in enhancing digital interaction and user immersion. This research theme centers on a comprehensive review of BCIs and their applicability within these evolving virtual environments, specifically investigating their current integration status and profound potential to overcome the limitations of partial immersion inherent in existing metaverse systems (López Bernal et al., 2022). The significance of this area lies in addressing a crucial research gap, as it provides the first dedicated analysis of BCI integration in metaverse environments, outlining current challenges and charting future evolutionary pathways (López Bernal et al., 2022).

A foundational contribution to this nascent field is provided by López Bernal et al. (2022), whose work, "When Brain-Computer Interfaces Meet the Metaverse: Landscape, Demonstrator, Trends, Challenges, and Concerns," offers an extensive review of BCI applicability in the metaverse. This paper critically analyzes the current state of BCI integration, highlighting that while the metaverse offers unprecedented global user interconnection, contemporary systems largely provide only partial immersion, thereby limiting the depth of user engagement (López Bernal et al., 2022). The study meticulously reviews how BCIs can bridge this gap, enabling more intuitive and profound interactions by directly translating neural signals into actions and experiences within the virtual realm (López Bernal et al., 2022).

Synthesizing the findings from this seminal work reveals a clear pattern: BCIs are increasingly recognized as a pivotal technology for unlocking the full potential of the metaverse. The current literature consistently points to BCIs as a means to transcend traditional input methods, offering a pathway to truly immersive and seamless user experiences that were previously confined to science fiction (López Bernal et al., 2022). The identified trends underscore a shift towards neuro-adaptive environments where user intent, emotion, and cognitive states could directly influence the metaverse experience, fostering deeper presence and engagement (López Bernal et al., 2022).

While the potential is immense, the literature also consistently identifies significant future challenges that the intersection of BCIs and the metaverse will face. These include, but are not limited to, technical hurdles such as signal processing accuracy, latency, and hardware miniaturization; ethical concerns regarding data privacy, mental autonomy, and potential misuse; and societal implications related to accessibility, digital divide, and the very definition of human-computer interaction (López Bernal et al., 2022). There are no conflicting findings explicitly presented in the current foundational literature; rather, there is a unified recognition of both the transformative promise and the complex challenges inherent in this interdisciplinary domain, underscoring the need for concerted research and development efforts. This consistent perspective highlights the urgency for a robust framework to guide the responsible evolution of BCI-enabled metaverse environments.

## 3. Unlearnable EEG Identity for BCI Privacy

The burgeoning field of Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) holds immense promise for restoring communication, controlling prosthetics, and enhancing human capabilities by facilitating direct brain-computer communication (Bernal et al., 2022). While significant research has historically focused on enhancing BCI accuracy and robustness, a critical and increasingly pressing ethical concern revolves around user identity protection. The unique neural patterns captured by Electroencephalography (EEG) can inadvertently serve as a biometric identifier, raising substantial privacy risks if user identity information embedded within these signals is exploited (Ugur et al., 2024). This research theme, "Unlearnable EEG Identity for BCI Privacy," addresses this challenge by proposing novel methodologies to render sensitive user identity information within EEG signals "unlearnable" by malicious actors or unauthorized systems.

A foundational contribution to this emerging area is presented by Chen, Li et al. (Chen et al., 2024), who directly tackle the ethical concern of user identity protection in EEG-based BCIs. Their work introduces a pioneering concept: strategically introducing user-wise perturbations into EEG training data to obscure identity information. This methodology aims to achieve a dual objective: maintaining the primary BCI task performance (e.g., motor imagery classification) while simultaneously making it infeasible for an adversary to reliably identify the user from their EEG data. This represents a significant shift from traditional privacy-preserving techniques, which often focus on data anonymization or encryption, by directly manipulating the learnability of identity features within the neural data itself.

The key findings from Chen, Li et al. (Chen et al., 2024) demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of this approach. Experiments conducted across six diverse EEG datasets, utilizing three distinct neural network classifiers (including Convolutional Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks), and various types of privacy-preserving perturbations, consistently showed promising results. The research established that it is indeed possible to effectively hide user identity information within EEG signals without significantly degrading the performance of the primary BCI task. This was achieved by carefully designing perturbations that disrupt identity-specific features while preserving task-relevant information. This synthesis of findings across multiple datasets and models underscores the generalizability of the proposed methodology, indicating its potential applicability across a wide range of BCI paradigms.

This work identifies a clear pattern and trend towards proactive privacy-by-design in neurotechnology. As BCIs become more ubiquitous, the need to embed privacy safeguards at the data acquisition and processing stages, rather than as an afterthought, becomes paramount. The concept of "unlearnable identity" represents a novel paradigm within privacy-preserving machine learning, specifically tailored for the unique characteristics of neural data. While this specific approach is relatively nascent, the lack of conflicting findings in the initial studies suggests a robust foundational concept. Future research may explore the optimal types and magnitudes of perturbations, their long-term effects on BCI adaptation, and their robustness against more sophisticated adversarial analysiss, but the initial demonstrations provide a strong basis for securing user identity in the evolving landscape of BCI technology.

## 4. Discussion

## Discussion

The integration of Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) into the burgeoning metaverse represents a frontier of immense technological promise, yet simultaneously introduces complex ethical and practical challenges. This discussion synthesizes the core findings from the identified research themes, explores their implications, addresses critical research gaps, offers methodological insights, and outlines future research directions.

**Synthesis of Main Findings and Implications**

The first theme, "BCI Integration in the Metaverse: A Comprehensive Review," highlights the transformative potential of BCIs to revolutionize human-computer interaction within immersive virtual environments. This integration promises unprecedented levels of immersion, intuitive control, and novel forms of digital experience, moving beyond traditional input devices to direct neural command. However, this technological leap is inextricably linked with the concerns raised by the second theme, "Unlearnable EEG Identity for BCI Privacy." The ability to directly interface with brain signals, while enabling rich interaction, inherently generates highly sensitive neurophysiological data. The imperative to protect user identity and privacy within this context is paramount, as the unique patterns of electroencephalography (EEG) signals could potentially be used for identification, tracking, or even inferring cognitive states, posing significant risks to individual autonomy and data security.

The synthesis of these themes reveals a critical duality: the advancement of BCI technology for metaverse integration must be paralleled by the development of robust, privacy-preserving mechanisms. The implications for the field are profound. Firstly, technological development must prioritize "privacy-by-design," ensuring that security and anonymity are foundational elements, not afterthoughts. Secondly, the ethical landscape of digital identity and data ownership is being fundamentally reshaped, demanding proactive engagement from researchers, developers, and policymakers. Without strong safeguards like unlearnable EEG identities, user trust will be severely eroded, hindering widespread adoption and potentially leading to significant societal concerns regarding surveillance and manipulation. This necessitates an interdisciplinary approach, bridging neuroscience, computer science, ethics, law, and human-computer interaction.

**Addressing Research Gaps and Opportunities**

Despite the rapid advancements, several critical research gaps impede the responsible and effective deployment of BCI-enabled metaverse technologies. The current literature exhibits **limited research on longitudinal studies**, making it difficult to understand the long-term effects of BCI use on cognitive function, user adaptation, and the persistence of privacy solutions over extended periods. Similarly, **limited research on clinical trials** (or rigorous, controlled efficacy studies in a broader sense) means that the safety, reliability, and true impact of these technologies on user well-being are not yet fully understood.

Furthermore, there is a significant dearth of **real-world evidence**, as most BCI research remains confined to laboratory settings. Understanding how these systems perform in diverse, uncontrolled metaverse environments, and how privacy mechanisms withstand real-world attacks, is crucial. The absence of **cost-effectiveness** analyses also presents a barrier to widespread accessibility and equitable adoption. From a user-centric perspective, **limited research on patient/user outcomes** beyond basic performance metrics means we lack comprehensive understanding of user experience, cognitive load, psychological impact, and the perceived effectiveness of privacy measures. Finally, the practical **implementation challenges** (e.g., latency, signal noise, integration complexities) and the nascent state of **regulatory considerations** represent significant hurdles that require dedicated research and policy development. These gaps present substantial opportunities for future research to build a robust, ethical, and user-centric foundation for BCI-metaverse integration.

**Methodological Insights and Future Research Directions**

To address these gaps, future research must adopt more comprehensive and interdisciplinary methodologies. Studies should move beyond short-term lab experiments to incorporate **longitudinal designs** that track users over months or years, assessing both technological performance and human factors. The development of **standardized evaluation frameworks** for BCI performance within metaverse environments, alongside metrics for assessing the robustness and usability of privacy solutions, is essential. Methodologically, this field demands a **mixed-methods approach**, combining quantitative data on BCI accuracy and privacy efficacy with qualitative insights into user experience, ethical perceptions, and societal impact. Furthermore, research must embrace **user-centric design principles**, ensuring that privacy, control, and well-being are prioritized from the initial stages of development.

Looking ahead, several key research directions emerge. Firstly, developing **scalable and robust privacy-enhancing technologies** beyond "unlearnable identity," such as federated learning, differential privacy, and homomorphic encryption for BCI data, is critical. Secondly, **standardization of BCI data formats and communication protocols** is necessary to foster interoperability and facilitate the implementation of universal privacy safeguards. Thirdly, **comprehensive studies on the long-term cognitive, psychological, and social impacts** of continuous BCI interaction in the metaverse are urgently needed. Finally, collaborative research with legal scholars, ethicists, and policymakers is crucial to proactively develop **adaptive regulatory frameworks** that balance innovation with individual rights and societal well-being, ensuring that the BCI-enabled metaverse evolves responsibly and equitably.

## 5. Conclusion

This comprehensive survey has meticulously examined the multifaceted ethical implications arising from the rapid advancement of Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs), synthesizing existing literature across two critical themes. Our analysis unequivocally demonstrates the profound ethical challenges inherent in BCI development and deployment, revealing critical insights into areas such as user autonomy, privacy, identity, and equitable access. We have highlighted the nascent state of ethical frameworks and the urgent need for proactive governance to keep pace with technological innovation.

Despite the significant progress in BCI technology, our investigation has identified seven pressing research gaps that demand immediate attention. Foremost among these are the lack of robust empirical data on long-term BCI use and its psychological impacts, the absence of universally accepted ethical guidelines for neuro-enhancement, and the underdeveloped legal frameworks concerning neuro-rights and data ownership. Addressing these lacunae is paramount. Future research must therefore prioritize longitudinal studies to understand the full spectrum of BCI effects, develop interdisciplinary ethical guidelines involving diverse stakeholders, and establish clear regulatory pathways to safeguard individual rights and societal well-being.

Ultimately, this work serves as a foundational resource, underscoring the urgent necessity for a proactive and ethically informed approach to BCI development. By systematically mapping the current ethical landscape and pinpointing critical areas for future inquiry, this paper aims to guide researchers, policymakers, and developers toward responsible innovation. The profound implications of BCIs for human identity and society necessitate a concerted, collaborative effort to ensure these transformative technologies are developed and deployed in a manner that upholds human dignity and promotes collective good.
