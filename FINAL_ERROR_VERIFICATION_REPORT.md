## Detailed Error Resolution Status

### 1. ‚úÖ KeyError: 'papers' - **RESOLVED**
**Original Error**: `KeyError: 'papers'` at `integrated_dashboard.py:1933`
**Root Cause**: Unsafe dictionary access without checking key existence
**Resolution Applied**:
- Enhanced `get_database_stats()` with comprehensive default values
- Changed all `stats['papers']` to `stats.get('papers', 0)` 
- Added fallback mechanisms for empty database states
**Verification**: ‚úÖ **TESTED AND CONFIRMED** - No more KeyError exceptions

### 2. ‚úÖ AttributeError: 'Paper' object has no attribute 'source' - **RESOLVED**
**Original Error**: `AttributeError: 'Paper' object has no attribute 'source'` at `integrated_dashboard.py:1035`
**Root Cause**: Missing `source` attribute in Paper model
**Resolution Applied**:
- Added intelligent `@property source` to Paper model
- Automatically determines source from venue, arxiv_id, DOI, etc.
- Handles: ArXiv, Conference, Journal, CrossRef, Unknown sources
**Verification**: ‚úÖ **TESTED AND CONFIRMED** - Source property working for all paper types

### 3. ‚úÖ Safety Filter and Response Blocked Errors - **ENHANCED**
**Original Error**: `Response blocked due to safety filters (finish_reason: 2)` in `gemini_client.py:236`
**Root Cause**: Gemini API safety filters triggering on research content
**Resolution Applied**:
- Enhanced retry logic with progressive safety levels
- Better prompt sanitization and academic content framing
- Improved fallback response generation
- Smart consecutive safety block tracking
**Verification**: ‚úÖ **ENHANCED HANDLING** - Better resilience to safety blocks

### 4. ‚úÖ Timeout and Connection Errors (Gemini) - **ENHANCED**
**Original Errors**: 
- `Timeout of 600.0s exceeded` with DNS resolution failures
- `503 failed to connect` with socket/handshaker errors
- `getaddrinfo: WSA Error 11001` DNS issues
**Root Cause**: Network/DNS connectivity issues
**Resolution Applied**:
- Added specific handling for DNS/network error patterns: `dns`, `getaddrinfo`, `handshaker`, `socket`, `connection`
- Enhanced retry logic with longer timeouts for network issues
- Progressive backoff strategies
- Better error classification and logging
**Verification**: ‚úÖ **ENHANCED ERROR HANDLING** - Network errors handled gracefully

### 5. ‚úÖ Export JSON Error - **RESOLVED**  
**Original Error**: `Error exporting draft to json: Format json handler not implemented`
**Root Cause**: Missing JSON export method in ExportManager
**Resolution Applied**:
- Added `_export_draft_json()` method to ExportManager
- Integrated JSON export into format selection logic
- JSON format already supported in configuration
**Verification**: ‚úÖ **TESTED AND CONFIRMED** - JSON export fully functional

### 6. ‚úÖ OpenAlex Connection Errors - **ENHANCED**
**Original Error**: `OpenAlex connection error (attempt 1/3)` leading to `No response data from OpenAlex`
**Root Cause**: DNS resolution and network connectivity issues
**Resolution Applied**:
- Enhanced DNS-specific error detection (`dns`, `getaddrinfo`, `11001`)
- Longer backoff periods for network issues (capped at 30 seconds)
- Better connection pooling and session management
- Improved error classification
**Verification**: ‚úÖ **ENHANCED HANDLING** - DNS-aware error handling implemented

### 7. ‚úÖ CrossRef Connection Errors - **ENHANCED**
**Original Error**: `CrossRef connection error (attempt 1/3)` with some queries failing
**Root Cause**: Similar DNS resolution and network connectivity issues
**Resolution Applied**:
- Enhanced DNS-specific error detection and handling
- Improved retry logic with capped exponential backoff
- Better error classification between network and API errors
- Connection session optimization
**Verification**: ‚úÖ **ENHANCED HANDLING** - DNS-aware error handling implemented

### 8. ‚úÖ Hugging Face Model Loading Error - **ENHANCED**
**Original Error**: `Failed to load semantic model` with `NameResolutionError` for `huggingface.co`
**Root Cause**: DNS resolution failure preventing model downloads
**Resolution Applied**:
- Enhanced error detection for network/DNS issues
- Graceful fallback to TF-IDF when semantic models unavailable
- Better error classification and user feedback
- Application continues working without semantic embeddings
**Verification**: ‚úÖ **ENHANCED HANDLING** - Graceful fallback confirmed, semantic models loaded when available

### 9. ‚úÖ Service Error Retries - **ENHANCED**
**Original Error**: Various `Service error, retrying in X seconds...` messages
**Root Cause**: Generic retry logic not optimized for different error types
**Resolution Applied**:
- Intelligent retry intervals based on error type
- Progressive backoff strategies with caps
- Better error classification (safety, quota, network, server)
- Context-aware retry timing
**Verification**: ‚úÖ **ENHANCED STRATEGIES** - Smarter retry logic implemented
