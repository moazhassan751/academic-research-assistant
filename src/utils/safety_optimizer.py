Due to API usage limitations, this section provides a structured framework for continued analysis.

### Systematic Approach
Please consider the following research methodology:

1. **Primary Source Analysis**
   - Review core academic literature
   - Examine peer-reviewed publications
   - Analyze authoritative sources

2. **Data Collection Strategy**
   - Define research parameters
   - Establish data quality criteria
   - Implement systematic collection methods

3. **Analysis Framework**
   - Apply appropriate analytical methods
   - Ensure methodological rigor
   - Maintain objective perspective

4. **Synthesis and Integration**
   - Combine findings coherently
   - Identify key themes and patterns
   - Draw evidence-based conclusions

### Next Steps
- Continue research after quota renewal
- Implement manual analysis using this framework
- Document findings systematically

*This framework maintains research continuity despite technical limitations.*

   - Establish evaluation criteria  
   - Apply consistent methodology

3. **Documentation Strategy**
   - Maintain detailed research logs
   - Track source credibility
   - Record analytical decisions

### Quality Assurance
- Verify source authenticity
- Apply academic standards
- Ensure reproducible methods
- Maintain ethical guidelines

### Expected Deliverables
- Comprehensive literature summary
- Thematic analysis results
- Evidence-based recommendations
- Future research directions
