# 🔧 Error Resolution Summary - Academic Research Assistant

## ✅ Issues Resolved

### 1. **Gemini API Safety Filter Warnings**
**Problem:** Content being blocked by safety filters causing retry loops
**Solution:** 
- Improved error handling with better context messages
- Reduced retry wait times for better user experience
- Added clearer logging to distinguish safety blocks from other errors

**Files Modified:**
- `src/llm/gemini_client.py` - Enhanced safety warning messages

### 2. **Text Length Warnings**
**Problem:** Excessive warnings for papers with short abstracts/content
**Solution:**
- Changed warnings to info logs for moderately short text (30-300 chars)
- Only show warnings for extremely short text (<30 chars)
- Improved fallback content handling

**Files Modified:**
- `src/agents/note_taking_agent.py` - Refined text length thresholds

### 3. **Generic Research Gap Identification**
**Problem:** Generic, non-topic-specific research gaps being identified
**Solution:**
- Implemented topic-specific gap analysis
- Added domain-aware gap categories (AI/ML, Astronomy, Medical, Technology)
- Made gap identification contextual to research topic
- Limited gaps to most relevant ones (max 7)

**Files Modified:**
- `src/agents/theme_synthesizer_agent.py` - Complete rewrite of `identify_research_gaps()` method

### 4. **System Monitoring and Health Checks**
**Problem:** No system health monitoring or error tracking
**Solution:**
- Created comprehensive health monitoring system
- Added error statistics tracking with recovery strategies
- Implemented project health checks
- Added new CLI command for health monitoring

**Files Created:**
- `src/utils/health_monitor.py` - System and project health monitoring
- `src/utils/error_handler.py` - Enhanced error handling with recovery strategies

**Files Modified:**
- `main.py` - Added `health` command
- `requirements.txt` - Added psutil dependency

### 5. **Export System Dependencies**
**Problem:** Some export formats unavailable due to missing dependencies
**Solution:**
- Installed all export dependencies (reportlab, python-docx, pdfkit, jinja2, psutil)
- Updated requirements.txt with all necessary packages
- Verified all export formats working

## 🎯 Key Improvements

### **Error Handling**
- Graceful degradation when APIs have issues
- Better retry strategies with exponential backoff
- Context-aware error messages
- Fallback content generation when primary processing fails

### **Performance Monitoring**
- Real-time system resource monitoring
- API response time tracking
- Error rate monitoring
- Project integrity checks

### **User Experience**
- Clearer progress messages
- Reduced noise in logs (warnings → info for common issues)
- Better error context and troubleshooting hints
- Health check command for system validation

### **Topic-Specific Intelligence**
- Research gaps now tailored to specific domains
- Domain-aware analysis (AI, Astronomy, Medical, etc.)
- Contextual recommendations based on research area
