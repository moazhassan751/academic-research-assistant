# 🤖 Question Answering Feature Guide

The Academic Research Assistant now includes a powerful AI-driven Question Answering (Q&A) feature that allows you to ask complex research questions and receive comprehensive answers based on the papers in your database.

## 🎯 Overview

Instead of just searching for papers, you can now ask specific research questions and get:
- **AI-synthesized answers** from multiple sources
- **Confidence scores** indicating answer reliability
- **Automatic source citations** with relevance rankings
- **Follow-up question suggestions** for deeper exploration

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Collect Papers First
Before asking questions, gather relevant papers:
```bash
python main.py research "transformer-based architectures"
python main.py research "computer vision transformers"
```

### 2. Ask Single Questions
```bash
python main.py ask "What are the recent trends in transformer-based architectures for vision tasks?"
```

### 3. Start Interactive Q&A Sessions
```bash
python main.py qa-session --topic "computer vision"
```

## 📋 Command Reference

### Single Question Command
```bash
python main.py ask "your question here" [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**
- `--topic, -t`: Filter papers by research topic
- `--limit, -l`: Maximum number of papers to consider (default: 10)
- `--save-result, -s`: Save the Q&A result to file

**Example:**
```bash
python main.py ask "How do Vision Transformers compare to CNNs?" --topic "computer vision" --limit 15 --save-result
```

### Interactive Q&A Session
```bash
python main.py qa-session [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**
- `--topic, -t`: Initial topic to focus the session on
- `--save-session, -s`: Save the entire Q&A session

**Example:**
```bash
python main.py qa-session --topic "transformer architectures" --save-session
```

### Interactive Mode Integration
```bash
python main.py interactive
# Then use:
research> ask What are the main challenges in transformer-based vision models?
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### How It Works

1. **Query Processing**: Extracts key terms from your question using NLP
2. **Paper Retrieval**: Searches database for relevant papers using semantic matching
3. **Relevance Ranking**: Scores papers based on title, abstract, and keyword relevance
4. **Context Extraction**: Extracts most relevant text snippets from top papers
5. **Answer Generation**: Uses LLM to synthesize comprehensive answer
6. **Source Attribution**: Provides citations and relevance scores
7. **Follow-up Generation**: Suggests related questions for deeper exploration

### Confidence Scoring

Answers include confidence scores (0.0 to 1.0):
- **0.7-1.0**: High confidence - comprehensive answer with multiple sources
- **0.4-0.7**: Medium confidence - partial answer, may need more sources
- **0.0-0.4**: Low confidence - limited information available

### Paper Matching Algorithm

The system uses multiple relevance signals:
- **Title matching** (50% weight): Direct keyword and semantic similarity
- **Abstract matching** (30% weight): Content relevance analysis  
- **Keywords matching** (20% weight): Technical term alignment
- **Citation bonus**: Popular papers get slight ranking boost

## 📊 Session Management

### Saving Results
Individual Q&A results can be saved as JSON files:
```json
{
  "question": "What are the recent trends...",
  "answer": "Based on the analysis of 12 papers...",
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "sources": [...],
  "follow_up_questions": [...],
  "timestamp": "2025-08-11T10:30:00"
}
```

### Session History

```json
{
  "session_start": "2025-08-11T10:00:00",
  "initial_topic": "computer vision",
  "questions": [
    {
      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "What are Vision Transformers?",
      "answer": "...",
      "confidence": 0.82
    }
  ],
  "total_questions": 5
}
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Performance Tuning

The Q&A system includes several configurable parameters:

```python
# In qa_agent.py
max_papers_for_context = 10      # Papers to analyze per question
max_context_length = 8000        # Token limit for LLM context
min_relevance_score = 0.3        # Minimum paper relevance threshold
```

### Database Optimization

For better Q&A performance:
- Collect 50+ papers per topic
- Include recent papers (last 2-3 years)
- Focus on high-quality sources
- Use specific technical keywords in research queries

## 🔍 Best Practices

### Writing Effective Questions

**Good Questions:**
- ✅ "What are the recent architectural innovations in Vision Transformers?"
- ✅ "How do transformer models handle computational efficiency in computer vision?"
- ✅ "What are the main limitations of applying attention mechanisms to image processing?"

**Less Effective Questions:**
- ❌ "What is AI?" (too broad)
- ❌ "Vision Transformers" (not a question)
- ❌ "Are transformers good?" (too simple)

### Optimizing Results

1. **Be Specific**: Use technical terms and specific concepts
2. **Ask Follow-ups**: Use suggested follow-up questions for deeper exploration
3. **Filter by Topic**: Use `--topic` flag to focus on relevant papers
4. **Check Confidence**: Lower confidence scores may indicate need for more papers
5. **Review Sources**: Check source relevance and citation counts

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Low Confidence Answers
- **Cause**: Few relevant papers in database
- **Solution**: Research more papers on the topic first

### No Papers Found Error
- **Cause**: Empty database or no matching papers
- **Solution**: Run `python main.py research "your topic"` first

### Generic Answers
- **Cause**: Question too broad or vague
- **Solution**: Make questions more specific and technical

### API Timeout Errors
- **Cause**: LLM API rate limiting
- **Solution**: Reduce paper limit or wait before retrying
